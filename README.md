### Data Structure

The data for this project is stored in the `src/` directory in several `data.*.js` files:

*   `src/data.books.js`: For books written by Alan Watts.
*   `src/data.kqed.js`: For the KQED television series "Eastern Wisdom & Modern Life".
*   `src/data.essential.js`: For "The Essential Lectures" video series.
*   `src/data.theworks.js`: For "The Works" audio series index.

### Adding New Information

To add new entries, edit the appropriate `data.*.js` file. Follow the existing structure for each entry. For example, to add a new book, you would add a new object to the `BOOKS` array in `src/data.books.js`:

```javascript
{
  year: "YYYY",
  title: "Book Title",
  link: "URL to source",
  notes: "Your commentary or notes about the book."
}
```

Please ensure that any links provided are to primary sources or reputable archives.
